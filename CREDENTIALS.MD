To obtain the credentials from Google Cloud, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Click on the project drop-down and select "New Project".
3. Enter a project name and click "Create".

### Step 2: Enable Google Photos Library API
1. In the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), select your project.
2. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library".
3. Search for "Google Photos Library API".
4. Click on "Google Photos Library API" and then click "Enable".

### Step 3: Set Up OAuth 2.0 Credentials
1. In the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
2. Click "Create Credentials" and select "OAuth 2.0 Client ID".
3. If prompted to configure the consent screen, do so by providing the necessary information (e.g., application name, email, etc.).
4. Select "Application type" as "Web application".
5. Enter a name for your OAuth 2.0 client (e.g., "Photos Uploader").
6. In the "Authorized redirect URIs" section, add `http://localhost:8080`.
7. Click "Create".

### Step 4: Retrieve Your Credentials
1. After creating the OAuth 2.0 client, you will see a dialog with your client ID and client secret.
2. Download the credentials JSON file.

The JSON file will have a structure similar to this:
```json
{
  "web": {
    "client_id": "xxx.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "project_id": "your-project-id",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_secret": "xxxxxx",
    "redirect_uris": [
      "http://localhost:8080"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Create `credentials.json` File
1. Create a file named `credentials.json` in your project directory.
2. Copy the contents from the downloaded JSON file and adapt it to match the format you need:
```json
{
  "identifier": "xxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com",
  "secret": "xxxxx",
  "authorizationEndpoint": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "tokenEndpoint": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "redirectUrl": "http://localhost:8080",
  "scopes": ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/photoslibrary"]
}

```

### Step 6: Secure Your Credentials
Ensure that `credentials.json` is not checked into version control. Add it to your `.gitignore` file:
```
# Add this line to your .gitignore file
credentials.json
```

### Summary
1. **Create and configure a Google Cloud project**.
2. **Enable the Google Photos Library API**.
3. **Create OAuth 2.0 credentials** and configure the consent screen.
4. **Download and adapt the credentials JSON file**.
5. **Use the credentials** in your Dart application.

Following these steps will ensure you have the necessary credentials to authenticate and interact with the Google Photos Library API.
